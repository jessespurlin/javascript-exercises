Project #3: The Array

Create a index.html and script.js file. When the index.html page is opened, the user should be prompted with three pop boxes that ask the following questions:

Give a number.
Give a another number.
Give a number again.
Then create a for loop that adds all the numbers together, and writes to the page “The sum of all of your numbers is _____.”
