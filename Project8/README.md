Bonus Project #8: Analog Clock
In this project, you are going to extend the clock in Project #6 to make it an analog clock. A screengrab is included here in the Project8 folder.
The clock should:

Have hour, minute and seconds hand.
The seconds hand should turn every second.
The seconds hand should have a transition effect (you may try any, the demo in class shows cubic-bezier).
If you get here and are ready for additional practice, please ask.
