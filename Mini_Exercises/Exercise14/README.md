# Javascript Mini-Exercise #14
Create a birthMonth object with the 12 month names for keys,  and person names for the value of each month. I.e., January: “Julia”, February: “Fergie”. 
- Use an HTML element event to call a function you wrote named displayBirthMonth() that uses a for/in loop to display the month and person names.
